There are 2 kinds of Volumes available in Kubernetes. AzureDisk and Azurefile.
 AzureDisk maps to a vhd. 
 AzureFile maps to a directory in an Azure Storage Account on a Fileshare.

Kubernetes Persistent Storage
Kubernetes has a concept called StorageClass. With StorageClasses administrators can offer Profiles regarding storage. For example a profile to store data on a HDD named slow-storage or a profile to store data on a SSD named fast-storage. The kind of storage is determined by the Provisioner. For Azure there are 2 kind of provisioners: AzureFile and AzureDisk.

The big difference between AzureFile and AzureDisk is the AccessMode. There are 3 AccessModes.
* ReadWriteOnce – the volume can be mounted as read-write by a single node
* ReadOnlyMany – the volume can be mounted read-only by many nodes
* ReadWriteMany – the volume can be mounted as read-write by many nodes

AzureFile supports all three. AzureDisk supports ReadWriteOnce only.
In the situation where a pod is configured to use a volume to write or read data to and is being restarted on a different host for whatever reason, you can’t use AzureDisk.

With the use of AzureDisk a vhd is attached to the node. The size of the node is dependent on the number of attached vhd’s. As a general rule you can have twice as many attached disks as CPU cores.

AzureFile uses SMB drives. Regarding performance is this not suitable to store the data of databases for example.

If you have multiple Pods of the same image (multiple replicas) that form a group that work together and you want to mount a volume per Pod to write data to. You may want to use StateFul Set.

As you can see all 3 StorageClasses in ACS are azure-disk type of storage.
 **  There is a standard storage to store to HDD and a premium to store to SSD. 
There is also 1 default storage. This one stores to HDD also and is marked as default StorageClass. It is possible to mark another StorageClass as default.
