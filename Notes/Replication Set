The replica set is the next generation Replication Controller

- Supports a new selector that can do selection based on FILTERING
according to set of values
   * e.g. "environment" either "dev" or "qa" etc.
   Relication Controller can only do "environment=="dev"
   The set can do more conplex matching.
   * Not only based on equality (quantity) like the Replication Controller

This Relica Set that than the Replication Controller, is used by the Deployment
Object.


Deployments

A deployment declaration in Kubenetes allows you to do app deployments and updates.

When using the deployment object you define the STATE of the your application.
 * Kubernetes will then make sure the clusters matches your desired state.

Just using the replciation controller or replication set might be cumbersone to
deploy apps... There is too much manual labor to adjust the state.
- updates, rollbacks etc...
